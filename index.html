			<h2> Welcome </h2>
	<article>
	<p> Sometimes life transitions or unexpected crises can seem challenging and we need to turn to others for help. 
	Counselling provides the opportunity to work through a particular problem. Through the counselling process, you will not only learn new ways to deal with the problems you are facing now, but you will also develop skills and new resources to assist you in the future. Counselling is a way of enabling choice or change or of reducing confusion. In the counselling sessions students can explore various aspects of their lives and feelings, talking about them freely and openly in a way that is rarely possible with friends or family. Counselling works through helping the client to cope better, not by advising or by providing answers, and not by directing a client. </p>

	<p>As a counsellors we believe acceptance and respect for the client are essential and, as the relationship develops, so too does trust between student  and the counsellor, which will help them to look at many aspects of their life, relationships, and themselves which they may not have considered or been able to face before. </p>
	<p>Our goal is that students understand themselves and their issues better, to get clarity and to get in touch with and develop coping and strengths in order to put plans into action to change their situation. </p>
	<p>We will not judge students, and we will offer a safe and confidential environment where students can explore freely issues that may be concerning them. Our desire as counsellors is to provide students with the best service possible and to create a safe environment for them to express themselves and grow. </p>
