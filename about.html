		<p> I have an 18 year history as a community and faith based youth worker. Running youth groups and teaching life skills programmes in schools. I have spent many years working with young people and their families helping them deal with the issues life throws at them.  I pride myself on being non-judgmental and easy to talk to. My goal is not to tell you what to think or believe, but to assist you in understanding yourself and supporting you as you journey through life.</p>
